Publish and Subscribe with Celery

Basic usage:
============

```python
import celery
import celery_pubsub

@celery.task
def my_task_1(*args, **kwargs):
    return "task 1 done"


@celery.task
def my_task_2(*args, **kwargs):
    return "task 2 done"
    
   
# First, let's subscribe
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.topic', my_task_1)
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.topic', my_task_2)

# Now, let's publish something
res = celery_pubsub.publish('some.topic', data='something', value=42)

# We can get the results if we want to (and if the tasks returned something)
# But in pub/sub, usually, there's no result.
print(res.get())

# This will get nowhere, as no task subscribed to this topic
res = celery_pubsub.publish('nowhere', data='something else', value=23)
```

Advanced usage:
===============

Wildcards can be used in topic names:

 * `*` matches any one group
    * `some.*.test` will match `some.awesome.test`, `some.random.test`
    but not `some.pretty.cool.test`, `elsewhere` or `here.some.up.test`
    * `some.*` will match `some.test` and `some.thing` but it won't
    match `some` or `some.testy.test`
 * `#` matches any number of groups
    * `some.#.test` will match `some.awesome.test`, `some.random.test`,
    `some.pretty.cool.test` but not `elsewhere` or `here.some.up.test`
    * `some.#` will match anything that starts with `some.`, such as
    `some.very.specific.topic.indeed`
    * `#` will match anything
 
 
```python

# Let's subscribe
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.*', my_task_1)
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.*.test', my_task_2)
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.#', my_task_3)
celery_pubsub.subscribe('#', my_task_4)
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.beep', my_task_5)
# it's okay to have more than one task on the same topic
celery_pubsub.subscribe('some.beep', my_task_6) 

# Let's publish
celery_pubsub.publish('nowhere', 4)               # task 4 only
celery_pubsub.publish('some', 8)                  # task 4 only
celery_pubsub.publish('some.thing', 15)           # tasks 1, 3 and 4
celery_pubsub.publish('some.true.test', 16)       # tasks 2, 3 and 4
celery_pubsub.publish('some.beep', 23)            # tasks 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6
celery_pubsub.publish('some.very.good.test', 42)  # tasks 3 and 4

# And if you want to publish synchronously:
celery_pubsub.publish_now('some.very.good.test', 42)  # tasks 3 and 4

# You can unsubscribe too
celery_pubsub.unsubscribe('#', my_task_4)

# Now, task 4 will not be called anymore
celery_pubsub.publish('some.very.good.test', 42)  # task 3 only

```
